            <p>Since 1976 we at Brothers’ have been pleased to provide a friendly and vibrant place to enjoy great food and company. Community is at the core of Brothers’. We foster a work environment based on integrity, mutual respect, and kindness. Our commitment to community is further reflected in our support of local businesses including many regional sources of the foods we serve. Our intentions extend outwards to the greater world as we strive to support sustainability by offering organic products as well as hormone- and antibiotic-free chicken, beef and wild seafood. We realize Ashland offers many dining opportunities and we thank you for choosing Brothers’. It is an
honor to know so many of you as part of our Brothers’ family of friends.</p>
