            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Kailaua'a Spa </p>
            
            <p>My company is called Kailaua'a Spa, it provides the classic spa services such as facials, massages, and nail services. It is high end and classy, and has a variety of therapists and masseuses. It is located within a resort and hotel in Maui, Hawai'i.
 </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience is women in their 30’s and above, it’s a place where they can go and relax, and is expensive and high quality enough where it weeds out the younger crowds. The people using this site are for people who are staying at the resort and want to relax. 
 </p>
           
            <p>Their goals are to find out which services are offered, see prices, and see who the masseuses are. Since most of the people using this site are visitors, they would be unfamiliar with the customs and want to learn more before just walking in.
 </p>
